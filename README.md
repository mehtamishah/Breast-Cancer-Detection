# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Building a classifier model to detect breast cancer.
Tested mupliple algorithms. Best performance was achieved on a k - nearest neighbors (K-NN) classifier model. <br>
On the test set, achieved <br>
Sensitivity = 0.95 # The ability to determine the patient cases (malignant tumors) correctly <br>
Specificity = 0.98 # The ability to determine the healthy cases (benign tumors) correctly <br>
roc_auc_score = 0.97
